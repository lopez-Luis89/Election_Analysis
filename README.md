-As you can see, the largest turn out is Denver with a total of 306055 votes getting 82.8 percent of the total  votes and Arapahoe has the lowest vote count of 24801 with a 6.7% of the votes

Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

Candidate Analysis:
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)

Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)

Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
Winning Vote Count: 272,892
Winning Percentage: 73.8%
-------------------------

From our results we can sewe that Diane DeGette had the highest percentage(73.8%) of the votes(272,892) making her the winning candidate of this election, trailing her we have Charles Casper with 23%(85,213) of the votes and lastly Raymon Anthony with 3.1%(11,606) of the total votes.

Lastly, I believe a modification of the script plus more data can be use to further analyze other aspects of an election in general:

1. Candidate  total votes by county
2. Percentage of candidate by county
3. Candidacy victory per county
4. Age group Preferance of candiate
